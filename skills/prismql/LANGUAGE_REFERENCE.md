# PrismQL Language Reference

**For LLM Agents**: Complete syntax specification for PrismQL query generation.

## Core Syntax

### Query Structure

```
SELECT <restrictions>
    [INWINDOW N | DURING N <unit>]
    [BEFORE(ts) | AFTER(ts) | BETWEEN(ts, ts)]
    [GROUP BY field [, ...]]
    [AGGREGATE func()]
    [ORDER BY field [, ...] [ASC|DESC]]
    [LIMIT N [OFFSET M]]
```

### Restrictions

Restrictions are conditions that messages must satisfy. Multiple restrictions are separated by commas or combined with boolean operators.

## Operators

### 1. Basic Filtering

```prismql
from(username)                    -- Events from a specific source (alias for field(user, ...)); quote a name with spaces
field(name, value)                -- Events where a field equals a value (exact, case-insensitive); a list-valued field matches if any element does
field(name, value, partial)       -- ... or contains it as a substring
contains(dictionary_name)         -- Messages containing dictionary words
contains_tokens(dictionary_name)  -- Token-based matching (preserves C++, emails)
contains_phrase("phrase")         -- Exact phrase matching
is_question()                     -- Messages that are questions
has_feature(feature_name)         -- Messages with custom annotated feature
mentions_user(name)               -- Messages that @mention an author (a $var binds one of the names)
mentions_date()                   -- Messages mentioning dates
mentions_time()                   -- Messages mentioning times
mentions_place()                  -- Messages mentioning locations
mentions_org()                    -- Messages mentioning organizations
contains_link()                   -- Messages containing a link (http:// or https:// up to whitespace)
similar_to("text", threshold)     -- Semantically similar messages (embedding cosine >= threshold)
```

**Mentions** (who addresses whom): a mention is `@` followed by a name one
of the corpus's authors has — the author field is the server's
`board.actor` (in the engine, `actor_field`; default `user`) — the longest
that fits, any case; an e-mail address (`cy@bob.org`) is not one. Names
with spaces or dots go in quotes: `mentions_user("Claude Opus 4.5")`,
`field(agent, "GPT-5.4")` (`from()` reads the `user` field only; quote a
name there too). `mentions_user(*)` is every message with a mention.
`mentions_user($y)` binds `$y` to a name the message mentions — the group
settles on the one a later link matches, so a later link can ask for that
author:
`SELECT mentions_user($y) FOLLOWED_BY field(agent, $y) DURING 10 minutes`
— a message addressing someone, answered by them; `field(agent, !$y)`
asks for anyone else (an event with no author is no one). Copies bound to
one variable (`mentions_user($y){2}`,
a comma list) share a mentioned name. Mentions come from a `mentions`
column (`prismql ingest … --annotate mentions --actor agent`) or are found
once at load.

**Semantic similarity**: `similar_to("oil sanctions", 0.7)` embeds the quoted
text and matches messages whose embedding cosine similarity is at or above
the threshold. The threshold is **required** (in `[0.0, 1.0]` — there is no
default) and the score is computed then discarded: the result is a plain
message set, so it composes through boolean and sequence operators like any
other predicate. Requires a backend with a semantic index (see
`prismql.backends.semantic.SemanticIndex`); without one the query fails
loudly rather than returning empty results.

**Text-matching semantics**: `contains()` routes each dictionary term by
its shape:

- **Multi-word terms always phrase-match** (order-sensitive, plain
  adjacent tokens): a dictionary entry `"margin call"` matches those words
  in that order, never `"call margin"`. This holds in every mode.
- **Single-word terms match by the corpus's `text_match` mode**, which is
  **`stem`** by default: whole words, folded by a Snowball stemmer in the
  corpus's `text_language` (`english` unless set; `german`, `russian`, …),
  so `fail` matches `failed` and `failing`, and `hi` does not match `this`.
  The other modes are `token` (whole words, no stemming: `rout` will not
  match `routes`) and `substring` (`work` matches `working`, but `hi` also
  matches `this` — for logs and identifiers, not prose). Set the mode per
  engine (`text_match="token"`; in server configs `[engine] text_match`,
  `[engine] text_language`, or per corpus) or **per dictionary**:

  ```toml
  [engine]
  text_language = "german"              # the stemmer both backends use

  [dictionaries]
  stems = ["laufen", "Haus"]            # stem mode (the default)

  [dictionaries.codes]
  match = "substring"                   # "ERR" matches "ERR_TIMEOUT"
  terms = ["ERR", "WARN"]
  ```

  The same long form (`{"terms": [...], "match": "token"}`) works in the
  library API and in the server's request-scoped `dictionaries` overlay.
  **A backend that cannot honour a mode refuses** at load or at the first
  `contains()` — tantivy has no substring matching — it never answers with
  a different meaning. Memory and tantivy stem with the same algorithm and
  language, so one query is one set on both.

`contains_tokens()` always matches whole tokens (Unicode-aware: preserves
C++, emails, contractions); `contains_phrase()` matches one exact phrase.

Text predicates read fixed text fields and no other column. Words — `contains()` and `contains_tokens()` — read `text`, `content` and `message` (tantivy: `text` only); a phrase — `contains_phrase()` or a multi-word dictionary term — reads `text` only; `is_question()`, `contains_link()` and `mentions_user()` (when mentions were not stamped at ingest) read `text`, `content` and `message`. When the corpus holds none of the fields a predicate reads, it refuses with an error instead of answering zero; text in another column is matched with `field(body, "word", partial)`. A phrase or a dictionary term with no letters or digits (`contains_phrase(" — ")`) refuses too: text is indexed as words, so punctuation alone would match nothing; find it with `field(text, "—", partial)`.
From Python on the memory backend, `BackendConfig(text_fields=["text", "body"])` makes the words in `body` searchable too; a phrase still reads `text` alone, and tantivy reads `text` whatever the config says.

**`contains(x)` is a dictionary name, `contains_phrase("x")` is a literal.**
`contains(timeout)` with no dictionary called `timeout` is an error
(`Dictionary 'timeout' not found`), not a search for the word; a quoted word
inside `contains()` is refused with a pointer to `contains_phrase()`. Define `timeouts = ["timeout"]` or
write `contains_phrase("timeout")`.

### 2. Boolean Operators

```prismql
SELECT from(alice) AND is_question()           -- Intersection
SELECT from(alice) OR from(bob)                -- Union
SELECT NOT from(alice)                         -- Negation
SELECT (from(alice) OR from(bob)) AND is_question()  -- Grouping
```

**Precedence**: `()` > `NOT` > `AND` > `OR`

### 3. Window Operators

#### INWINDOW (Positional Co-occurrence - UNORDERED)

Finds messages appearing within N positions of each other. Order does NOT matter.

```prismql
SELECT from(alice), from(bob) INWINDOW 5
SELECT is_question(), contains(answers) INWINDOW 10
SELECT from(customer), from(support), contains(solution) INWINDOW 15
```

**Key characteristic**: UNORDERED - `SELECT A, B INWINDOW 5` ≡ `SELECT B, A INWINDOW 5`

#### Sequential Operators (ORDERED)

Sequential patterns require strict ordering. Supports both positional (INWINDOW) and temporal (DURING) windows.

```prismql
-- Positive lookahead: A followed by B (positional)
SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 3

-- Positive lookahead: A followed by B (temporal)
SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) DURING 30 seconds

-- Positive lookbehind: B preceded by A
SELECT from(bob) PRECEDED_BY from(alice) INWINDOW 2

-- Negative lookahead: A NOT followed by B
SELECT from(alice) NOT_FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 5
-- A variable on the excluded side binds nothing (that event is not in the
-- group): it narrows the excluded event to one agreeing with the left side.
-- A tool failed and the same session never called it again:
SELECT field(outcome, error) AND field(tool, $t) AND field(session, $s)
    NOT_FOLLOWED_BY field(tool, $t) AND field(session, $s) DURING 1 hour

-- Negative lookbehind: B NOT preceded by A
SELECT from(bob) NOT_PRECEDED_BY from(charlie) INWINDOW 3

-- Compound conditions compose naturally (AND/OR bind tighter than FOLLOWED_BY)
SELECT from(alice) AND is_question() FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) AND contains(answers) INWINDOW 5

-- Chaining: a single trailing window applies to every link
SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) FOLLOWED_BY from(charlie) INWINDOW 10

-- Chaining: links may also carry their own windows; positional and temporal mix freely
SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 10 FOLLOWED_BY from(charlie) DURING 5 minutes
```

**Key characteristics**:
- ORDERED - first pattern must appear before/after second
- No SELECT wrapper needed
- AND/OR bind tighter than sequential operators - compound conditions need no parentheses
- Supports DURING for temporal windows (e.g., `DURING 30 seconds`)
- Chaining allowed - one trailing window applies to the whole chain, or give each link its own

**Window constraint rules**:
- **Required**: the final link of a chain must have a window (INWINDOW or DURING)
- **Chaining**: `A FOLLOWED_BY B FOLLOWED_BY C INWINDOW 10` - a trailing window applies to every windowless link (per link, not whole-chain span)
- **Per-link**: `A FOLLOWED_BY B INWINDOW 10 FOLLOWED_BY C DURING 5 minutes` - links may carry individual windows; INWINDOW and DURING mix freely
- **Whole group**: a second `DURING` after the chain's window bounds the span of the whole group: `A FOLLOWED_BY A FOLLOWED_BY A DURING 1 hour DURING 1 day` - each step within an hour, the whole group within a day. A second `INWINDOW` there is refused, not dropped: bound the whole group with `DURING`. A chain of repeats still gives one group per starting event, not one per series — use `RUN` (section 4)
- **Positional**: `INWINDOW N` - messages within N positions
- **Temporal**: `DURING <time>` - messages within time duration

**DEPRECATED**: `WITHIN` is deprecated, use `INWINDOW` for positional or `DURING` for temporal windows.

#### Temporal Operators (Time-based)

```prismql
SELECT from(alice), from(bob) DURING 1 hour
SELECT from(alice), from(bob) DURING 30 minutes
SELECT from(alice), from(bob) DURING 2 days
```

**Time units**: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks

**Difference**:
- `INWINDOW N` = positional distance (N messages apart)
- `DURING TIME` = temporal distance (within TIME of each other)

### 4. Quantifiers

```prismql
SELECT from(alice){2}          -- Exactly 2 messages
SELECT from(alice){2,5}        -- Between 2 and 5 messages
SELECT from(alice){2,}         -- At least 2: needs quantifier_ceiling (see below)
```

`{n,}` has no upper bound to enumerate to, so it needs a ceiling: it is
rejected (`OPEN_QUANTIFIER`) unless `quantifier_ceiling = m` is configured
(`PrismQLEngine(quantifier_ceiling=m)`; server: `[engine] quantifier_ceiling`),
which reads every `{n,}` as `{n,m}`; a minimum above the ceiling is rejected too.
Prefer an explicit `{n,m}`. A range enumerates every size in it: `{2,3}`
over three matching messages in the window returns the three pairs and the
triple.

**Runs: `RUN(X){n,m}`.** A quantifier counts *combinations*; a run counts
*repeats in a row*. `RUN(X){n,m}` gives one group per maximal run of X:
the events of X, split by the values of the variables X names (one run per
agent with `field(agent, $a)`), whose neighbours are at most the step
apart. Runs never overlap; events that are not X between the members do not
break a run; runs shorter than n or longer than m are dropped, never cut.
The window after `RUN` is the step and is required; a second `DURING`
bounds the whole run (a second `INWINDOW` is refused). A `DURING` step reads
X's events in time order, and events at the same time join one run; an
`INWINDOW` step counts every event of the stream between neighbours.

```prismql
-- The same agent asked 7+ times, each within an hour of the last, all within a day
SELECT RUN(field(kind, REQUEST_GOOGLE_SIGN_IN) AND field(agent, $a)){7,}
    DURING 1 hour DURING 1 day
-- How many such runs
SELECT RUN(field(kind, retry) AND field(session, $s)){3,} INWINDOW 5 AGGREGATE count()
```

For a series use `RUN`, not `X{7}` (every 7 of 20 repeats is 77,520 groups)
and not a chain of 7 links (one group per starting event, overlapping).

**A run in a link.** Inside a chain the step goes inside the parentheses,
`RUN(X, DURING 1 minute){3,}`, and the window after the link is the link's
own. A run takes part in one link, on either side, positive or negative;
the group is the run and the event it links to, in time order, one per
left-hand group as with any `FOLLOWED_BY`. A variable named on both sides
holds one value across the link (`!$k` on the condition side: another
value):

```prismql
-- A request, then within 10 minutes a run of 3+ retries by the same agent
SELECT field(kind, request) AND field(agent, $a)
  FOLLOWED_BY RUN(field(kind, retry) AND field(agent, $a), DURING 2 minutes){3,}
  DURING 10 minutes
-- A run of failures the same agent never followed with a success
SELECT RUN(field(outcome, error) AND field(agent, $a), DURING 5 minutes){3,}
  NOT_FOLLOWED_BY field(outcome, ok) AND field(agent, $a) DURING 10 minutes
```

Runs are found over the whole stream first, then linked: a linked event
that falls inside a run does not split it, and one run can be the nearest
for several left-hand events. `RUN(X, step){n,} DURING <span>` alone bounds
the whole run, like `RUN(X){n,} DURING <step> DURING <span>`. A longer
chain around a run, a run beside other restrictions, inside AND/OR or under
a quantifier are refused loudly. A lone run may also be a whole subquery:

```prismql
SELECT (SELECT RUN(field(kind, retry)){3,} DURING 2 minutes)
  FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT field(kind, success)) INWINDOW 10
``` `run` stays a plain word as a
field value: `field(kind, run)`.

### 5. Pattern Variables

Match messages with the same field value:

```prismql
SELECT from($user), from($user) INWINDOW 5                    -- Same user twice
SELECT from($speaker) FOLLOWED_BY from($speaker) INWINDOW 2  -- User followed by themselves
SELECT from($u) FOLLOWED_BY from(!$u) INWINDOW 3            -- ... followed by a DIFFERENT user
```

`!$k` is "unequal to the value an earlier leg bound to `$k`": the nearest
candidate is chosen among those that differ (`UNBOUND_NEGATED_VARIABLE` if
nothing bound `$k` before it). On the leg that binds `$k` itself it differs
inside the event, as `$k` twice there is equal inside it:
`SELECT field(user, $a) AND field(kind, !$a)` — events whose kind is not
their user — alone, in a comma list or in a chain, and inside a `RUN`. Joined to `$k` by `OR` or under `NOT` it is refused (`OWN_NEGATION_NOT_UNDER_AND`).

**Variable names**: `$user`, `$speaker`, `$person`, `$author` (any identifier starting with `$`)

**Variables in sequential chains**: same-value constraints are enforced
across FOLLOWED_BY/PRECEDED_BY legs (each leg binds the variable for its
message in the matched group). When every leg carries exactly one
constraint on the same variable and field, matching runs independently
within each field-value partition — interleaved chains from different
values are all found, and a nearer candidate with the wrong value never
shadows the real match. Two restrictions apply:
- The chain must be the entire SELECT body — chain variables cannot be
  combined with other comma-separated restrictions or quantifiers
  (runtime error).
- Variables on the right-hand side of `NOT_FOLLOWED_BY` / `NOT_PRECEDED_BY`
  bind nothing — the excluded message is not in the group — and narrow what
  counts as excluded: `$k` to a message with the left side's value, `!$k`
  to one with another value. Each must be bound on the left side (an error
  otherwise). A left message without that value has nothing that agrees
  with it, so it is kept.

### 6. Named Groups

```prismql
SELECT from(alice) AS "alice_messages",
       is_question() AS "questions"
```

### 7. Aggregation

```prismql
SELECT from(alice) AGGREGATE count()
SELECT from($user), from($user) INWINDOW 3 AGGREGATE count()
SELECT contains(problems) GROUP BY user AGGREGATE count()
SELECT from(alice) GROUP BY day(timestamp) AGGREGATE count()
```

Functions: `count()`, `count(DISTINCT field)`, `distinct(field)`,
`sum(field)`, `avg(field)`, `min(field)`, `max(field)`.

**Important**: aggregation functions always take parentheses —
`AGGREGATE count()`, never `AGGREGATE count`. `GROUP BY` is supported,
over plain fields and temporal units (`hour(ts)`, `day(ts)`, `week(ts)`,
`month(ts)`, `year(ts)`).

**One function per query**: `AGGREGATE count(), sum(x)` is an error — run
one query per function.

**What `count()` counts: result groups, not entities.** `A FOLLOWED_BY B`
returns one group for every event that matches `A` and has a partner, so
two start events on one page are two matches and count twice. Stream
`1 delete P`, `2 delete P`, `3 save P`, `4 delete Q`, `5 save Q`:

```prismql
SELECT field(kind, delete) AND field(page, $p) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, save) AND field(page, $p) INWINDOW 10
-- groups [1, 3] [2, 3] [4, 5]: AGGREGATE count() is 3, for 2 pages
SELECT field(kind, delete) AND field(page, $p) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, save) AND field(page, $p) INWINDOW 10 AGGREGATE count(DISTINCT page)
-- 2: the pages that have at least one match
SELECT field(kind, delete) AND field(page, $p) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, save) AND field(page, $p) INWINDOW 10 GROUP BY page AGGREGATE count()
-- {P: 2, Q: 1}: matches per page; the number of keys is the number of pages
```

Pick the one that answers the question asked:

- *how many matches* — `count()`; *how many entities have one* —
  `count(DISTINCT field)`; *how many per entity* — `GROUP BY field AGGREGATE
  count()`.
- `count(DISTINCT f)` collects `f` from **every** event of every group, both
  legs. It counts entities only when every leg carries the same value (the
  `$p` above). If the field differs between legs (the asker and the
  answerer), it counts both sides' values together; `GROUP BY f` keys each
  group by its **first** event alone, so its keys are the first-leg values.
- To count the other end, flip the operator: `B PRECEDED_BY A` gives one
  group per `B`, each with its nearest earlier `A` (here `[2, 3] [4, 5]`).
  It is another question, not the same pairs reversed.
- There is no "keep one group per entity" stage. To keep the first (or any
  one) match per page, read the groups and deduplicate by the first event's
  field outside the language.

**ORDER BY** sorts groups by the fields' values on each group's first
event: `SELECT from(alice) ORDER BY timestamp DESC`. Several fields sort by
their values in order; one `ASC`/`DESC`, written once after the last field,
applies to all of them (a mix is an error). A group whose first event lacks
a field goes last; equal values keep stream order. A field no event in the
result has, or values of mixed types, is an error.

### 8. Subqueries

Execute independent queries and merge results within a window. Preserves grouping semantics.

**Syntax**:
```prismql
SELECT
    (SELECT restriction1, restriction2 INWINDOW N1) ;
    (SELECT restriction3, restriction4 INWINDOW N2)
    INWINDOW N3
```

**Examples**:

```prismql
-- Multi-stage pattern: problem → solution
SELECT
    (SELECT from(customer), contains(problems) INWINDOW 3) ;
    (SELECT from(support), contains(solutions) INWINDOW 3)
    INWINDOW 15

-- Question → answer → acknowledgment
SELECT
    (SELECT is_question(), from(user1) INWINDOW 2) ;
    (SELECT from(user2), contains(answers) INWINDOW 2) ;
    (SELECT from(user1), contains(thanks) INWINDOW 2)
    INWINDOW 10

-- Sequential subqueries
SELECT
    (SELECT from(customer), contains(problems) INWINDOW 3)
    FOLLOWED_BY
    (SELECT from(support), contains(solutions) INWINDOW 3)
    INWINDOW 10

-- Sequential subqueries with single restriction (still needs SELECT!)
SELECT
    (SELECT from(alice), from(bob) INWINDOW 3)
    FOLLOWED_BY
    (SELECT from(charlie))
    INWINDOW 8
```

**Critical rules for subqueries**:

1. **Subqueries require SELECT wrapper** - When using independent subquery syntax `(SELECT ...)`:
   - ✅ Subquery: `(SELECT from(alice)) FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT from(bob)) INWINDOW 3`
   - ✅ Simple: `SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 3` (no wrapper needed!)

   **Note**: For simple sequential patterns, SELECT wrappers are no longer required. Only use subquery syntax when you need independent query contexts with their own windows.

2. **Positional operators between subqueries act on whole groups.**
   `(SELECT A) FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT B) INWINDOW n` matches a group from A
   with a group from B when *every* message of the A-group precedes *every*
   message of the B-group and the positional gap from A's last message to
   B's first is within `n` (greedy closest match, like the restriction
   level). Matched groups are concatenated chronologically, so multi-message
   stages stay intact: `(SELECT a, b INWINDOW 3) FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT c) INWINDOW 8` yields groups `[a, b, c]`. `NOT_FOLLOWED_BY` /
   `NOT_PRECEDED_BY` keep the left groups that have no such counterpart.

   - Each positional link carries its own `INWINDOW n` — a chain cannot
     take an *extra* trailing positional window (runtime error). To bound
     the overall time span of the matched groups, add `DURING <time>`.
   - A single parenthesized subquery is the identity: `SELECT (SELECT X)`
     returns exactly what `SELECT X` returns.

3. **Variables do not cross subqueries.** Each `(SELECT ...)` binds its own `$u`:
   `(SELECT from($u)) FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT from($u)) INWINDOW 5` pairs *any* two
   users, not the same one twice. For the same value across steps write one
   flat chain: `SELECT from($u) FOLLOWED_BY from($u) INWINDOW 5`.

4. **Do NOT flatten subqueries** - Grouping semantics matter!

```prismql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Preserves grouping (alice+bob together, charlie separate)
SELECT (SELECT from(alice), from(bob) INWINDOW 3) ;
       (SELECT from(charlie)) INWINDOW 8

-- ❌ WRONG: Loses grouping (all three mixed)
SELECT from(alice), from(bob), from(charlie) INWINDOW 8
```

## Complete Examples

### Basic Queries

```prismql
SELECT from(alice)
SELECT from(alice) AND is_question()
SELECT from(alice) OR from(bob)
SELECT NOT from(alice)
```

### Window Co-occurrence

```prismql
SELECT from(alice), from(bob) INWINDOW 5
SELECT is_question(), contains(answers) INWINDOW 10

SELECT from($user) AND is_question()
       FOLLOWED_BY from($user) AND contains(thanks)
       INWINDOW 5
```

## Operator Compatibility

**Sequential operators work naturally with AND/OR** (boolean operators bind tighter):

```prismql
-- ✅ CORRECT: AND has higher precedence than FOLLOWED_BY
SELECT from(alice) AND is_question() FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) AND contains(answers) INWINDOW 5
-- Parsed as: (from(alice) AND is_question()) FOLLOWED_BY (from(bob) AND contains(answers))

-- ✅ Also correct: use parentheses for clarity
SELECT (from(alice) AND is_question()) FOLLOWED_BY (from(bob) AND contains(answers)) INWINDOW 5

-- ✅ CORRECT: chaining with compound conditions and one trailing window
SELECT from(alice) AND contains(problems) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) FOLLOWED_BY from(charlie) AND contains(solutions) INWINDOW 10
```

**Precedence (highest to lowest)**:
1. `()` - Parentheses
2. `NOT` - Negation
3. `AND` - Conjunction
4. `OR` - Disjunction
5. `FOLLOWED_BY`, `PRECEDED_BY`, etc. - Sequential operators (lowest)

## Common Patterns

### Support Analytics

```prismql
-- Problem → solution pairs
SELECT contains(problems), contains(solutions) INWINDOW 10

-- Unanswered questions

       NOT_FOLLOWED_BY from(support)
       INWINDOW 5

-- Escalation pattern
SELECT from(customer) AND contains(problems),
       from(customer) AND contains(escalation),
       from(manager)
       INWINDOW 20
```

### Conversation Analysis

```prismql
-- Same user asking and answering
SELECT from($user) AND is_question(),
       from($user) AND contains(answers)
       INWINDOW 5

-- Rapid back-and-forth (chaining with a single trailing window)
SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) FOLLOWED_BY from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 1

-- Monologue detection (a run of one speaker)
SELECT from(alice){5} INWINDOW 10

-- Unanswered messages (a negative lookaround carries its own window;
-- it may open a chain or follow another NOT_ link, never a positive one:
-- A FOLLOWED_BY B NOT_FOLLOWED_BY C is refused,
-- A NOT_PRECEDED_BY S DURING 30 minutes FOLLOWED_BY C DURING 2 hours runs)
SELECT from(alice) NOT_FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 10
```

## Grammar Rules

### Restriction Combinations

1. **Comma-separated restrictions** = co-occurrence within window
   - `SELECT A, B INWINDOW 5` → Find A and B within 5 messages (unordered)

2. **Boolean operators** = set operations
   - `SELECT A AND B` → Messages matching both A and B
   - `SELECT A OR B` → Messages matching A or B
   - `SELECT NOT A` → Messages not matching A

3. **Sequential operators** = ordered patterns
   - `SELECT A FOLLOWED_BY B INWINDOW N` → A then B within N messages (ordered)
   - `SELECT A PRECEDED_BY B INWINDOW N` → B then A within N messages (ordered)

### Window Semantics

- **Position** is a message's place in the stream: the order the corpus was
  loaded in. IDs are labels only — gaps between numeric IDs and the sort
  order of string IDs do not affect distance.
- **INWINDOW N**: positional distance — at most N positions apart
  (`A FOLLOWED_BY B INWINDOW 1`: B is the very next message).
- **DURING** on comma-separated restrictions: the whole matched group must
  span at most TIME (`max(ts) - min(ts) <= TIME`).
- **DURING** on a sequential link (`A FOLLOWED_BY B DURING TIME`):
  directional — B must occur *strictly after* A and within TIME of it.
- **No window**: All results from restriction (no proximity constraint)

### How Matches Are Chosen

Sequential links (`FOLLOWED_BY`, `PRECEDED_BY`, chains):
- **Nearest partner, one per message.** Each message matching the left side
  gets the single nearest eligible message on the right side, after it for
  `FOLLOWED_BY`, before it for `PRECEDED_BY`, along the window's axis
  (positions for `INWINDOW`, time for `DURING`) — never every message in the
  window. Stream `a1 a2 b1 b2`: `SELECT from(a) FOLLOWED_BY from(b) INWINDOW 5` → `[[a1, b1], [a2, b1]]`.
- **Partners are shared.** Two left messages may pick the same partner (`b1`
  above).
- **Strictly later in time.** On a `DURING` link the partner's timestamp must
  be strictly later (strictly earlier for `PRECEDED_BY`): a message with the
  same timestamp never continues the sequence, even when it is next in the
  stream. `INWINDOW` links look at positions only.
  Stream (user, time): `1 alice 100`, `2 bob 100`, `3 bob 101`.
  `from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 1` → `[1, 2]` (next in the
  stream; time is not looked at); `from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) DURING
  10 seconds` → `[1, 3]` (event 2 shares alice's time, so it is not later);
  `from(alice), from(bob) DURING 10 seconds` → `[1, 2]` and `[1, 3]` (a
  comma row asks only for a span of at most 10 seconds, so equal times
  pass). `DURING 0 seconds` on a sequential link therefore matches nothing.
- **Ties go by position.** Among candidates with the same timestamp the
  nearest in the stream wins: the earliest going forward, the latest going
  backward.
  Stream (user, time): `1 alice 100`, `2 bob 105`, `3 bob 105`:
  `from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) DURING 10 seconds` → `[1, 2]`, not
  `[1, 3]`; going backward, `from(bob) PRECEDED_BY from(alice) DURING 10 seconds` over
  `1 alice 100`, `2 alice 100`, `3 bob 105` → `[2, 3]`.
- **Chains grow link by link.** Each element is the nearest after the
  previous one; a trailing window bounds every link, not the whole chain; no
  message appears twice in a group.
- **Pattern variables choose, not filter.** `$k` / `!$k` pick the nearest
  message whose value fits; a message with another value in between does not
  break the match.
- **No timestamp, no temporal link.** A message without a timestamp takes no
  part in `DURING` — on either side of a link, in co-occurrence, and on the
  left of `NOT_FOLLOWED_BY` / `NOT_PRECEDED_BY` (it is dropped, not reported
  as "not followed"); on the excluded side it blocks nothing.

Co-occurrence (comma-separated restrictions): every combination of one
message per restriction, all distinct, within the window; restriction order
does not matter and each set is returned once. Stream `a1 a2 b1 b2`:
`SELECT from(a), from(b) INWINDOW 5` → all four `[a, b]` pairs.

Order inside a result group: a sequence lists its messages in sequence order,
each before the next along its link's axis (`A FOLLOWED_BY B` and
`B PRECEDED_BY A` both give `[A, B]`); co-occurrence lists them along the
window's axis — stream order for a positional window, time order for a
temporal one, ties by stream position. With positional windows all of this is
stream order; it differs only when timestamps run backwards in load order, and
the engine warns when they do.

A result of one condition (`SELECT from(alice)`, `SELECT contains(x) OR field(k, v)`) lists one message per group in stream order — ids are labels,
never the order, so any mix of id types works.

## Syntax Decision Tree

**Need same user/field value across restrictions?**
→ Use pattern variables: `from($user), from($user) INWINDOW 5`

**Need specific order?**
→ Use sequential: `from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 3`

**Need co-occurrence (any order)?**
→ Use INWINDOW: `from(alice), from(bob) INWINDOW 5`

**Need time-based proximity?**
→ Use DURING: `from(alice), from(bob) DURING 1 hour`

**Need to count results?**
→ Use AGGREGATE: `SELECT from(alice) AGGREGATE count()`

**Need multi-stage patterns with grouping?**
→ Use subqueries: `SELECT (SELECT A, B INWINDOW 3) ; (SELECT C) INWINDOW 10`

## Response Format

**Always respond with ONLY the PrismQL query**:
- Start with `SELECT`
- No explanations before or after
- No markdown code blocks (unless explicitly requested)
- No comments in the query

**Example**:
```
User: Find questions from alice or bob within 5 messages
Response: SELECT (from(alice) OR from(bob)) AND is_question() INWINDOW 5
```

**Last verified against the implementation**: 2026-06-10 (after the grammar fix
restoring the intended precedence and chaining semantics)

Notes:
- A trailing window distributes per link over a chain; the final link must have
  a window (omitting it is a runtime error with a fix-it message)
- Positional (INWINDOW) and temporal (DURING) windows mix freely across the
  links of one chain
- NOT binds tighter than AND, which binds tighter than OR; sequential operators
  bind loosest

Earlier breaking change (2025-11-14): sequential operators no longer require SELECT wrappers; DURING added for temporal sequential patterns.
