description: Run PrismQL pattern-matching queries over sequential data (conversations, logs, agent traces, events, transactions) — via a local prismql-server if one is running, else directly via Python. Use when the user wants to find sequential/co-occurrence/temporal patterns in ordered records ("X followed by Y", "A and B within N messages", repeated behavior by the same entity), investigates agent behaviour in logs (contagion, streaks, never-followed, lead-lag, with a null twin), or asks to "seed"/set up PrismQL for a specific dataset.

# PrismQL — executable pattern queries over sequential data

PrismQL is "regex for event sequences": a query language over ordered
records. A query names a shape in the stream and returns every instance of
it — the events themselves, grouped, never a summary.

**Read `LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md` in this directory before your first query**,
then the Pitfalls section below.

## Start here: is a server running?

**`8901` is only the default port — use the port the person gave you, and
ask if they did not.** On any other port the probe below answers
connection-refused, and you would wrongly conclude there is no server.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8901/health    # anything but connection-refused → up
```

If it is up, that is the whole interface — no Python, no data loading.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8901/schema    # do this before writing any query
```

`/schema` describes the loaded corpus: fields with coverage and types,
example values for categorical fields (your `from()` / `field()` targets),
the configured dictionaries, the timestamp field, the text-match mode.
Read it instead of guessing field names. Two things it does not say
outright:

- `fields[].type` is the type of the value as it was loaded — a timestamp
  read from JSON or CSV shows as `"str"` even though the engine parsed it.
  That field does not tell you whether the time axis works.
- the top-level `timestamp_field` is the axis `DURING` measures on, and it
  must name a field that appears in `fields`. When no event has a time in
  it, a time query stops with an error that names the columns that do hold
  times: say that to the person and fix the config, rather than rewriting
  the query.

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8901/evaluate -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 5", "max_results": 20}'
```

Body fields, all optional but `query`: `max_results` (the inline cap, see
below), `hydrate` (`true` by default; `false` returns ids only),
`dictionaries` (term lists for this request), `output` (`"inline"` or
`"file"`), `corpus` (a name from `GET /corpora`), `label` (a slug for the
results file). `max_results` never goes above the server's own cap (50
unless configured); a larger request is cut to it and says `truncated:
true` — page on with `GET /results/<result_id>`. `GET /schema?corpus=<name>`
describes one corpus; `coverage` is the share of events holding a value.

The response carries hydrated event groups (`results[].events`). A bad
query comes back as a structured 422 whose `error.message` says what to
change — read it and retry rather than guessing again. One case the
message does not name: **every query begins with `SELECT`**; leave it out
and the 422 reports the operator it tripped on (`Unexpected 'FOLLOWED_BY' after query`), not the missing keyword.

Other endpoints: `GET /reference` (the full language doc), `GET /corpora`
(named corpora; pass `"corpus": "<name>"` in the request to pick one),
`GET /results/{result_id}` / `GET /results/{result_id}.jsonl` (page or
stream a kept match or scout result — rate-limited like the endpoints
above; the `.jsonl` response carries an `X-PrismQL-Total` header with the
number of lines the stream will send), `POST /reload` (off unless the
server enables it).

**Scout before you query.** Two endpoints answer "what is where" with
ranked hits — outside the language, which never ranks:

- `POST /search` `{"query": "timeout OR \"rate limit\" OR fail*", "limit": 20}` —
  full-text over the `text` field in tantivy syntax (`AND`/`OR`/`NOT`,
  quoted phrases, `field:term`, `prefix*`), stemmed, BM25 best first.
- `POST /similar` `{"text": "the agent gave up on the task", "limit": 20}` —
  nearest events by cosine over the corpus's embedding index (needs an
  ingested `emb` column or `[semantic].model`; 422 otherwise). Optional
  `threshold`.

Both take `corpus`, `hydrate` (`false` = ids and scores only, no events)
and `output: "file"` (all hits to a JSONL file, a five-row preview back —
up to `scout_depth` hits; your request's own `limit` does not narrow that
file), exactly like `/evaluate`. Send `X-PrismQL-Client: <your name>` on every
request: the server keeps a journal of requests (`GET /activity`) and shows
it to the person on `/board/` — with your name, they can follow what you
asked and open any of it themselves — use them to read a few hits, learn the words
people actually wrote, then put those words in a dictionary and ask the
real question with `/evaluate`. Hits are `{"id", "score"[, "event"]}`, kept
server-side under a `result_id` exactly like a match result — page them the
same way.

**Who addresses whom.** `mentions_user("Claude Opus 4.5")` finds messages
that `@mention` that author; `mentions_user($y)` binds each mentioned name,
so `SELECT mentions_user($y) FOLLOWED_BY field(agent, $y) DURING 10 minutes` is "addressed, then answered by the one addressed" and
`field(agent, !$y)` "answered by someone else". A mention is `@` plus an
author name that exists in the corpus — e-mail addresses do not count.

**Ask why an event is there.** `"explain": true` on `/evaluate` (or
`?explain=true` on `GET /results/<id>`) adds `explain` to each group: per
event, the conditions it satisfies — `{"predicate": "contains(evalaware)", "matches": [{"term", "field", "start", "end"}]}` with character offsets
into that field, `{"predicate": "similar_to(…)", "score": 0.61}`, or just
the name for `field(…)`. Conditions under `NOT` never appear. Use it to
tell a dictionary that is too broad from a hit whose word sits past what
you read — before you narrow the dictionary. A query with pattern
variables also gets `bindings` per group: what the engine bound its
variables to there, e.g. `[{"a": "GPT-5", "y": "o3"}]` — usually one
assignment; several when the engine folded them into one group (a comma
row whose items look alike) or a `mentions_user($y)` still holds several
names nothing narrowed to one. `null` means the engine bound nothing for
that group — stages of a subquery do not carry their variables across. A
page lists at most 20 and adds `"bindings_truncated": true` when there were
more. `!$k` binds nothing and is not listed.

**Read around an event before you name what it is.** `GET /context?id=<id>& minutes=10&same=agent` returns the events around one event in stream order
— within ten minutes before and after, only those with the same `agent` —
each with its `offset` from the event (`0`), `time`, and its fields under
`event` (`events[i].event.text`, not `events[i].text`). Without
`minutes` it takes `before`/`after` events (10 each, at most 200); `same` is
any field. One call instead of two queries and a join.

### Four things about the server that will bite you

1. **A match or scout result is kept, not just returned — page it, don't
   re-run it.** `result_id` is opaque — treat it as an unparsed token, not
   "r" plus a counter; the hex suffix is what keeps an id held from before a
   restart from matching a different result on the new process, where the
   counter alone repeats from 1. A plain aggregate (no `GROUP BY`, or
   `GROUP BY` without `AGGREGATE`) is small and returned inline only — no
   `result_id`, not kept. `GROUP BY ... AGGREGATE` is the one exception
   that gets both: it answers inline in full (its `grouped_values`) AND is
   kept as a `"rows"` result with a `result_id`/`total`, pageable the same
   way. `count` is how many items
   *this response* carries,
   `max_results` is the page size, `total` is how many the query found, and
   `"truncated": true` means paging further returns more. Fetch the rest
   with `GET /results/{result_id}?offset=…&limit=…&hydrate=…&fields=…` (the
   MCP shim's `result_page(result_id, offset, limit)` does the same), or
   stream every kept item at once with `GET /results/{result_id}.jsonl`.
   Scouting keeps only its best `scout_depth` hits and reports that as
   `kept` — `total` can exceed `kept`, and then `truncated` turns false at
   `kept`, not `total`. A stale id (server restarted, `/reload` ran, or the
   result aged out of the memory budget) comes back as a 404 with
   `error.type == "gone"` — run the query again, do not retry the page.
   For a real total regardless of paging, `AGGREGATE count()` still counts
   every group, uncapped.
2. **Enumerating past the cap in one shot needs permission.** `"output": "file"` writes every kept group (or up to `scout_depth` hits for
   scouting) as JSONL server-side and returns `{count, path, preview}`; on a
   server without `[server] enable_file_output = true` it answers 403. For
   a match result, paging by `result_id` works either way and needs no
   permission — use it instead of asking to enable file output.
3. **Dictionaries are per-request.** Add `"dictionaries": {"name": ["term", …]}` to the body to define or override term lists for that
   query only. Iterate there; ask for stable ones to be persisted into the
   server's `prismql.toml`.
4. **Kept results do not survive a reload or a restart.** They live only in
   memory, on the load they were computed on; the person restarting the
   server or reloading corpora mid-conversation means your next page comes
   back `gone` — that is expected, not a bug to report.

## Starting a server yourself

One JSON object per line; `id` and a timestamp field are the only fields
the engine needs named, everything else is queryable with `field()`:

```toml
# prismql.toml
[server]
port = 8901

[backend]
type = "memory"                 # < ~100K rows; "tantivy" for real full-text
data = "events.jsonl"           # .json / .jsonl / .csv / .parquet
timestamp_fields = ["time"]     # parsed on load

[engine]
timestamp_field = "time"        # the axis DURING measures on

[dictionaries]
failures = ["failed", "error", "timeout"]   # stemmed whole words: "fail" ~ "failed"
```

```bash
uv sync --extra server                  # from a clone; not on PyPI yet
uv run --extra server prismql-server --config prismql.toml
```

One timestamp key is enough: the other follows, and with neither the server
takes `timestamp` if the file has it, else `time`; a time query over a field
without times is an error, not an empty answer. Stream order is the file
order; ids are labels and may be strings.

A table in the wrong order or shape, or a harness log folder, becomes that
file through `prismql ingest`: `prismql ingest table SRC DST.parquet --id COL --time COL [--sort COL] [--keep a,b] [--embed text --model M]`; several
streams into one corpus: `prismql ingest table A.csv b=B.jsonl DST.parquet --id id --time time --sort time --source-col source` (ids become `LABEL:id`;
ask across them with `field(source, a) … FOLLOWED_BY field(source, b) …`);
`prismql ingest claude-code ~/.claude/projects/<project> DST.parquet` and
`prismql ingest codex ~/.codex/sessions DST.parquet` give one event per
prompt / thought / tool call / tool result (`kind`, `tool`, `error`,
`session`, `model`, `text`). A call carries its structure and its end:
`cmd` (the first program a shell command runs: `git`, `curl`, `rm` — past
`cd`, `sudo`, assignments, loop headers; quoted text and heredocs are not
programs), `path` (the file read or written), `host` (from a URL a network
program or fetch is given), `action` (`read`, `write`, `exec`, `network`,
`destructive` — recursive rm, `git reset --hard`, force push, `git clean -f`, `find -delete`, `dd of=`, DROP/TRUNCATE through a SQL client),
`outcome` (`ok`, `error`, `none` — no result), `duration_ms` (call to
result, so a wait for the user's approval counts), `output_chars`, and the
words `duration_bucket` (`instant` < 1s, `short` < 10s, `medium` < 1m,
`long` < 10m, `very_long`) and `output_bucket` (`empty`, `small` < 1k
chars, `medium`, `large`, `huge` ≥ 100k); `call` joins a call to its
result. Codex marks `error` only for a non-zero exit of its exec tool and
reads files through the shell, so its failure and read counts are not
comparable with Claude Code's. Claude Code sub-agent events carry `agent`,
and the call that started one carries it as `spawned`:
`field(spawned, $g) FOLLOWED_BY field(agent, $g) DURING 1 hour`. Point `data` at the
Parquet, `time` is the timestamp field. With `--embed`, `similar_to()` works without any
`[semantic]` config: the file carries the vectors and the model name.

Keep `--extra server` on `uv run` too: `uv run` re-syncs the environment to
the project defaults first, and a bare `uv run prismql-server` in a fresh
clone drops FastAPI and fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

## The language, and what its text matching is

Every leg of a pattern is a filter on one event; the operators between legs
are the language. Text matching exists only to name such a filter, and it
is deliberately narrow — **no ranking, no relevance, a set of ids in, a set
of ids out**:

| Predicate | Matches | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `field(name, value)` | a field equals a value (case-insensitive); `from(x)` = `field(user, x)` | field index |
| `contains(dict)` | a text field (`text`, `content`, `message`; phrases and tantivy: `text` alone) holds any term of a named dictionary | inverted token index (memory) / tantivy FTS |
| `contains_tokens(dict)` | same, whole tokens only (keeps `C++`, emails) | same |
| `contains_phrase("…")` | one exact phrase | same |
| `similar_to("…", 0.7)` | embedding cosine ≥ threshold | semantic index, if configured |

The text predicates read only the corpus's text fields — by default `text`,
`content` and `message`, **not** every column: with that default a `body` or
`title` column is queryable with `field()` but `contains()` does not look in
it. On a corpus with none of those columns a text predicate refuses with
an error; on one where only some events hold `text`, the others simply do
not match. When a count looks too small, compare `contains_phrase("word")`
with `field(body, "…", partial)`; the reliable fix is a corpus whose text
sits in a column called `text` (check `/schema`). A dictionary is the semantic
layer: invest there, and pass it in-band while iterating.

What you can rely on, because every sequence and window operator is one
implementation over the ordered corpus:

- positional distance is stream distance — ids are labels, string ids fine;
- `A, B INWINDOW n` is unordered and commutes; `FOLLOWED_BY` is ordered and
  takes the nearest eligible match per left-hand event;
- a group never holds the same event twice; slots come back in stream
  order;
- `{n,m}` enumerates every size in the range, one group per set;
- pattern variables are held while the nearest candidate is chosen, so two
  variables on one leg, or a variable that skips a leg, both work;
- a subquery stage merges as one group per stage, the union's span counting
  toward the outer window;
- a backend with no order axis (a tantivy index built before the axis
  sidecar) refuses sequence operators instead of guessing.

## Pitfalls

1. **A chain's final link must carry a window.** One trailing window covers
   every windowless link (per link, not whole-chain span); links may also
   mix `INWINDOW` and `DURING` individually.
   - ✅ `SELECT a FOLLOWED_BY b FOLLOWED_BY c INWINDOW 2`
   - ✅ `SELECT a FOLLOWED_BY b INWINDOW 2 FOLLOWED_BY c DURING 1 minute`
   - ❌ `SELECT a FOLLOWED_BY b INWINDOW 2 FOLLOWED_BY c` (no window on final link)
2. **Precedence: `NOT` > `AND` > `OR` > sequential operators.** Compound
   conditions next to `FOLLOWED_BY` need no parentheses:
   `SELECT from(alice) AND is_question() FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 5`
   means `(alice ∧ question) FOLLOWED_BY bob`. Use parens only to override.
3. **Use the subquery form only to sequence multi-event stages.** For
   simple sequences plain `a FOLLOWED_BY b INWINDOW n` is equivalent and
   simpler. `SELECT (SELECT a, b INWINDOW 3) FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT c) INWINDOW 8` matches whole groups (all of stage 1 before stage 2, gap
   measured from the stage's last event to the next stage's first) and
   concatenates them. Three rules, all of them enforced:
   - **the outer `SELECT` is not optional** — a query that starts with
     `(SELECT …)` is a syntax error (`Expected '(' after select`). The
     reference's Subqueries section shows one without the outer `SELECT`
     as valid; it is not — this rule wins;
   - **every link carries its own window**, including the last one;
   - **an extra trailing positional window is rejected** (runtime error
     naming this rule) — use `DURING <time>` for an overall time bound.
4. **`contains(x)` takes a dictionary NAME**, never a literal word. For a
   literal use `contains_phrase("exact phrase")`, or define a dictionary.
   Text predicates read only `text`, `content` and `message` (phrases and
   tantivy: `text` alone): on a corpus whose text is in `body` they refuse —
   use `field(body, "word", partial)`. Punctuation alone (`contains_phrase(" — ")`)
   is no word and refuses — use `field(text, "—", partial)`. A multi-word
   dictionary term is a phrase: matched word for word, **not stemmed**
   ("ran into" does not find "run into"). `field(x, *)` is the events whose
   `x` holds a value (not null, not empty); `from(*)` is every event.
5. **`INWINDOW` is unordered; `FOLLOWED_BY` is ordered.** "A then B" →
   `FOLLOWED_BY`; "A and B near each other" → comma + `INWINDOW`.
6. **Don't flatten multi-stage patterns.** `SELECT (SELECT a, b INWINDOW 3) FOLLOWED_BY (SELECT c) INWINDOW 8` keeps a+b grouped; `SELECT a, b, c INWINDOW 8` does not mean the same thing.
7. **Same entity twice → a pattern variable**, not two literals:
   `from($u) AND is_question(), from($u) INWINDOW 5`. `!$u` is "a
   *different* one". On the excluded side of a negated operator a variable
   binds nothing (that event is not in the group) and only narrows it:
   `field(outcome, error) AND field(tool, $t) AND field(session, $s) NOT_FOLLOWED_BY field(tool, $t) AND field(session, $s) DURING 1 hour` is
   "failed and never retried in that session"; bind it on the left first.
   A variable binds the value
   slot of `field()` too, not only `from()`. "The same page deleted and
   then saved again":
   - ✅ `SELECT field(kind, delete) AND field(page, $p) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, save) AND field(page, $p) DURING 10 minutes`
   - ❌ the same query without `$p` — it runs, and returns pairs where one
     page was deleted and a different one saved. Dropping the variable
     does not fail, it answers another question.
8. **`{n,}` is rejected** unless the server or engine sets
   `quantifier_ceiling` — there is no upper bound to enumerate to. The
   validator's code is `OPEN_QUANTIFIER`; over HTTP it is a 422 naming
   `quantifier_ceiling`. Write `{n,m}`, or ask for the ceiling to be set.
9. **"N times in a row" is a run, not a quantifier or a chain.** `X{7}`
   counts every combination of 7 (20 repeats → 77,520 groups); a chain of
   7 links gives one overlapping group per starting event. `RUN(X){7,}`
   gives one group per maximal run, split by the variables in X, the first
   window the step, a second `DURING` the whole run (a second `INWINDOW` is
   refused):
   - ✅ `SELECT RUN(field(kind, retry) AND field(agent, $a)){7,} DURING 1 hour DURING 1 day`
   - pipe: `run(field(kind, retry) and field(agent, $a)){7,} |> during(1h) |> during(1d)`
   - in a link the step goes inside: `SELECT field(kind, request) AND field(agent, $a) FOLLOWED_BY RUN(field(kind, retry) AND field(agent, $a), DURING 2 minutes){3,} DURING 10 minutes` — one link, either side, NOT_ too; one group per left-hand group;
   - refused: a longer chain around a run, a run beside a comma, inside AND/OR or under a quantifier;
   - runs are found over the whole stream before the link: a request that falls inside another request's run of retries does not start its own run.
10. **`AGGREGATE count()` counts match groups, not entities.** `A
    FOLLOWED_BY B` gives one group per event matching `A` that has a partner:
    two start events on one page are two matches. Stream `1 delete P`,
    `2 delete P`, `3 save P`, `4 delete Q`, `5 save Q`, with
    `Q1 = SELECT field(kind, delete) AND field(page, $p) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, save) AND field(page, $p) INWINDOW 10`:
    - `Q1` → `[1, 3] [2, 3] [4, 5]`; `Q1 AGGREGATE count()` → **3**, for 2 pages;
    - pages with a match: `Q1 AGGREGATE count(DISTINCT page)` → **2**;
    - matches per page: `Q1 GROUP BY page AGGREGATE count()` → `{P: 2, Q: 1}`;
    - `count(DISTINCT f)` reads `f` off every event of every group, so it
      counts entities only when both legs carry the value (`$p` here); for a
      field that differs between legs use `GROUP BY f`, which keys each group
      by its **first** event;
    - the other end: `field(kind, save) PRECEDED_BY field(kind, delete) INWINDOW 10`
      is one group per save (`[2, 3] [4, 5]`) — a different question, not the
      same pairs reversed;
    - **limit**: no stage keeps one group per entity. To take the first
      match per page, page the groups and dedup by the first event's field in
      your own code.
11. **`DURING` needs a strictly later time; `INWINDOW` looks at stream
    position only.** Stream (user, time) `1 alice 100`, `2 bob 100`,
    `3 bob 101`: `from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) INWINDOW 1` → `[1, 2]`;
    `from(alice) FOLLOWED_BY from(bob) DURING 10 seconds` → `[1, 3]` — event 2
    has alice's own timestamp, so it never continues the sequence (for
    `PRECEDED_BY` likewise, strictly earlier). `from(alice), from(bob) DURING
    10 seconds` is a comma row, a span of at most 10 seconds: it keeps both
    `[1, 2]` and `[1, 3]`. Among several partners with one timestamp the
    nearest in the stream wins — going forward the earliest, going backward
    the latest. Timestamps running backwards in load order make `INWINDOW`
    (load order) and `DURING` (timestamps) disagree; the engine warns.
    If a `DURING` query drops a pair you can see, compare the two timestamps.

## Investigating: from a question to a finding

A count is not a finding. The loop that makes one:

1. **Shape the question** as events in order: *then* (`FOLLOWED_BY`),
   *near* (comma + `INWINDOW`/`DURING`), *same / another entity*
   (`$a` / `!$a`), *never followed* (`NOT_FOLLOWED_BY`), *in a row*
   (`RUN`). Name the corpus.
2. **Run it** on the server; read `warnings` in the answer — a warning names
   a query that runs but asks something else.
3. **Run its null twin** — the same query with exactly the tested part
   broken — and compare the two counts.
4. **Read groups** before believing either number: `"explain": true` on
   `/evaluate` says why each event matched; `/context` shows what surrounds
   a group.
5. **Record** question → query → corpus → count → twin's count → a few ids
   read → verdict (confirmed / not / unclear), and the limits.

### Question shapes

Each of these runs on the hackathon corpora (`village`, `wiki_msgs`,
`urlquery`; fields from `/schema`):

| Question | Query |
|---|---|
| Does a help request spread to *other* agents within an hour? | `SELECT field(kind, REQUEST_HUMAN_HELPER) AND field(agent, $a) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, REQUEST_HUMAN_HELPER) AND field(agent, !$a) DURING 1 hour` |
| Which help requests are never cancelled by the same agent? | `SELECT field(kind, REQUEST_HUMAN_HELPER) AND field(agent, $a) NOT_FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, CANCEL_REQUEST_FOR_HUMAN_HELPER) AND field(agent, $a) DURING 1 hour` |
| Who waits again and again? (one group per streak, per agent) | `SELECT RUN(field(kind, WAIT) AND field(agent, $a)){5,} DURING 10 minutes` |
| A message on a wiki page, then one from *another* address on the same page | `SELECT field(kind, add) AND field(page, $p) AND field(ip16, $i) FOLLOWED_BY field(kind, add) AND field(page, $p) AND field(ip16, !$i) DURING 1 day` |
| Bursts of significant reports from one data source | `SELECT RUN(field(confidence, significant) AND field(data_source, $d)){5,} DURING 10 minutes` |
| How many per day? | `SELECT field(kind, REQUEST_HUMAN_HELPER) GROUP BY DAYS(time) AGGREGATE COUNT()` — each matched group counts once, on its first event's day |
| Two streams, who comes first? | unite them at ingest (`prismql ingest table A B OUT --source-col source`), then `field(source, a) … FOLLOWED_BY field(source, b) …` on the one corpus |

`!$a` on the leg that binds `$a` means "differs inside the event"
(`field(user, $a) AND field(kind, !$a)` — kind is not the user); joined to
`$a` by `OR` or under `NOT` it is refused. A list field (mentions, tags)
matches `field(name, v)` when any element is `v`.

### The null twin, in the language itself

The twin keeps everything but the one thing the claim is about:

- *"another agent"* → keep "another agent" and break the link in time or
  in identity: shift one side's events by a fixed lag, or shuffle which
  agent made each request, and rerun on that copy. `$a` instead of `!$a`
  is **not** a twin — it asks another question ("does the agent ask
  again?"), not the background the spread is measured against;
- *"within an hour"* → widen or shift the window and see whether the count
  scales with the window (background) or stays (an effect);
- *"after X"* → replace X by a control event of similar frequency;
- *"never followed"* → compare with the positive `FOLLOWED_BY` count.

A twin that returns 0, or exactly the same count, is usually the wrong twin.

### Semantic fields: label at ingest, query as fields

Regexes and dictionaries miss "the agent gave up", "the person corrected
it". Ask a local decision model at ingest and query the answer as a field:
`prismql ingest … --judge questions.toml` (a `strands-decider serve` or
Kev server on localhost; `examples/judge/agent-logs.toml`). Each question
becomes a label column (`yes`/`no`, an option, a level, or `unsure`) plus
`<name>_p`; the model and the exact questions are stamped into the file.
Check labels on a sample first — confidence is calibrated on the model's
data, not yours, and English reads better than Russian.

### Shapes that answer wrong today

- `mentions_user($y) FOLLOWED_BY field(agent, $y)` gives one group per
  ping, the first responder only, not one per mentioned name;
- a quantifier over a whole chain, `(A FOLLOWED_BY B …){2}`, takes the first
  two chain matches;
- semicolon subqueries with `DURING`, `(SELECT a) ; (SELECT b) DURING 1 hour`, can drop matches — use a comma row;
- `AS "name"` labels can land on the wrong member of a comma row;
- `NOT from($u)` with `$u` bound nowhere answers `[]` instead of refusing;
- pipe `|> within(n) |> during(t)` silently keeps one window;
- an ISO time with an offset (`+02:00`) is read as UTC wall-clock — the
  hackathon corpora are all UTC.

## Validate before executing (Python path)

```python
from prismql import QueryValidator
v = QueryValidator(user_dictionaries=dicts)   # same dicts as the engine
r = v.validate(query)
if not r.valid:
    feedback = [(i.message, i.suggestion) for i in r.errors]  # → fix and retry
```

Over HTTP the 422 body does the same job; feed the message back and retry,
at most three attempts before asking the person.

A query can also run and answer something else than you meant. The
`/evaluate` answer then carries `warnings` (`code`, `message`,
`suggestion`). Read them before you report a number:
- `REPEATED_LINKS`: three or more identical links give one overlapping
  group per starting event — for repeats in a row use `RUN`;
- `SUBQUERY_SHARED_VARIABLE`: each subquery binds its own `$k` — write one
  chain;
- `QUANTIFIER_COMBINATIONS`: a quantifier's groups are combinations, and
  `AGGREGATE count()` over it counts combinations too — to count events
  drop the quantifier.
From Python, `QueryValidator().validate(q).warnings` names the first two
(among other hints); the third needs the answer.

## No server: inline Python

From a clone `uv sync`, or in another project `uv add --editable /path/to/prismql`. If `import prismql` already works, skip both.

```bash
uv run python - <<'EOF'
from prismql import PrismQLEngine
from prismql.backends.memory import MemoryBackend

docs = [  # any ordered records; load yours from JSON/CSV/parquet here
    {"id": 1, "text": "can you help me with an error?", "user": "alice", "timestamp": 1000},
    {"id": 2, "text": "try clearing the cache, that fixes it", "user": "bob", "timestamp": 1001},
]

engine = PrismQLEngine(
    search_backend=MemoryBackend(docs, id_field="id"),
    user_dictionaries={
        "problems":  ["error", "broken", "bug", "issue"],
        "solutions": ["fix", "fixes", "solve", "works"],
    },
)

for group in engine.execute("SELECT contains(problems) FOLLOWED_BY contains(solutions) INWINDOW 5"):
    print(group)   # e.g. [1, 2]  — matching record ids, in stream order
EOF
```

Backends: `MemoryBackend` (< ~100K rows), `TantivyBackend` (`[tantivy]`
extra, real full-text, persisted with `index_path`). Data in a database
becomes a corpus through `prismql ingest table`, not through a backend. Documents are dicts with `id`, `text` (for text predicates), `user`
(for `from()`), `timestamp` (for `DURING`); other fields allowed and
queryable with `field()`.

Result shapes:

- `engine.execute(q)` → `list[list[id]]`, one inner list per match group;
- `AGGREGATE count()` → `AggregateResult`; `.to_dict()` →
  `{'function': 'count', 'field': None, 'value': N}`;
- `AS "name"` → `NamedQueryResult`; `.get_named_group(i)` → `{name: id}`;
- full records for a group: `backend.get_documents(group)` (the server
  hydrates them for you).

## Seeding an application-specific spec

Asked to "set up / seed PrismQL for <dataset>", write a project skill so
future sessions query it without rediscovery:

1. Sample ~20 records; find the ordering; map columns → `id` / `text` /
   `user` / `timestamp`. Pick the backend from size and format.
2. Draft 5–15 domain dictionaries from the sampled vocabulary (trading
   news: `earnings_beat`, `sanctions_new`). This is the semantic layer.
3. Write the loader, or a `prismql.toml` if the project runs the server.
4. Smoke-test three queries — one filter, one `INWINDOW`, one
   `FOLLOWED_BY` — and paste the real output in.
5. Write `.claude/skills/prismql-<dataset>/SKILL.md` from
   `SEED_TEMPLATE.md` (in this directory) and copy this directory's
   `LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md` alongside it (`cp -L`: it is a symlink).

The seeded skill must stand alone: loader or config, field mapping, full
dictionary definitions, example queries with their actual output, and the
quirks found while smoke-testing.
