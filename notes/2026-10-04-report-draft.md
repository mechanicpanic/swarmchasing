# What the swarms did: agent behaviour in public traces, each claim with its query and its count against chance

*Draft, 2026-10-04. Sections land as candidates are tested. Status of every candidate:
`notes/2026-10-04-candidates.md`. Graph `@aleph/prismql` #157, case №3.*

**Status of this draft: skeleton. No section below has passed its test yet.** Until a section carries its count and
its null, read it as an observation, not a finding.

## How this report differs from an incident report
METR's report on the OpenAI / Hugging Face incident tells its episodes in time order, quoting the agents, and says
openly that its agent analysis could not be checked. This report keeps the shape: sections headed by claims, episodes
with quoted agent text, a timeline, limitations, and a methods appendix. It adds one rule. Every claim carries:
- the PrismQL query that shows it, run against the server named in the appendix;
- the count, and against it a null that breaks exactly the tested thing (or a statement that the claim is about
  existence, with no rate to test);
- the board label the query was saved under;
- record ids, so anyone can open the rows.

A claim whose count falls inside its null is reported in "Did not hold", not dropped.

## Data
| Corpus | What one row is | Span | Rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `village` | one event of AI Village: an agent's message, thought, session start/stop with its self-summary, a human's message | 2025-04-02 → 2026-09-19 | 569,540 |
| `wiki_msgs` | the text one DSEwiki save added or removed, plus admin deletes and script probes | 2026-05-17 → 07-14 | 26,655 |
| `swarm_msgs` | `wiki_msgs` plus timed rows from the other venues the collusion.wiki explorer lists | 2026-05 → 07 | 27,050 |
| `urlquery` | a urlquery.net report Transluce flagged as an agent-activity candidate | 2026-04 → 07 | 38,160 |

## Summary
*(one line per section that holds, written last)*

## 1. The DSEwiki swarm
Verified claim by claim in a separate session, swarmchasing-d0, on PR #5 (`notes/2026-10-03-dsewiki-report.md`): rounds
relayed between cohorts, a PRNG seed brute-forced, alphabetical admin sweeps and a ZZZ backup page, a proxy bypass
passed between labels, and what did not beat chance (another name confirming on the same page). This report reuses
that chapter as it stands once PR #5 merges. It is not re-derived here.

## 2. … *(sections from approved candidates, in the order they hold)*

## Did not hold
*(questions tested and found inside their null, with the numbers)*

## Limitations
- Village rows are what the platform published: messages, thoughts, session summaries. The agents' private memory
  and their computer-use actions are not in the stream. A claim about what an agent *did* on its computer rests on its
  own summary.
- Names are not agents. Human display names in Village are self-chosen ("adam (but not that adam)"). Wiki labels are
  self-chosen, and one author can rotate them.
- Community-venue rows without a date are unverified and are never quoted as agent text.
- Village is for research use only: quotes are kept short and nothing is exported.

## Methods appendix
- Server: PrismQL on :8931 (`make serve`), corpora as above. Every query is signed `X-PrismQL-Client: swarmchasing-9d`
  and saved under its board label.
- Nulls on `village`: `runs/village_null.py QUERY --keep <rows the query can see> --shuffle <rows whose times move>
  --key <strata>`. It keeps every row any leg can match, permutes the times of the shuffled rows within each stratum,
  and re-runs the query inline. Strata must be wider than the window (graph #161). A shuffle has to swap times between
  rows that differ in the tested attribute: permuting within (day, agent) leaves "another agent within an hour"
  unchanged by construction (smoke run: 71 → 71).
- Nulls on `wiki_msgs`: `runs/null_twin.py --unit rev --key day,page` (PR #5).
